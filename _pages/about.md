I’m Mario Golbano Corzo, a Telecommunications Engineer based in Madrid. Currently, I’m pursuing a double Master’s in Telecommunications Engineering and Machine Learning, combining a solid technical foundation with a passion for ML/AI and next-generation communication technologies. My studies and experiences have given me hands-on expertise in data analytics, automation, and developing solutions within telecommunications.

Over the past few years, I’ve developed a strong interest in how advanced technologies like AI and machine learning intersect with telecommunications. My current studies allow me to explore this intersection, particularly through projects focused on high-frequency antenna technology and signal processing.

Looking ahead, I’m eager to apply my skills in an environment that values innovation and problem-solving. I’m ready to make an impact in the fast-evolving world of telecommunications and beyond.
