I'm Mario, a Telecommunications Engineer based in Madrid, currently expanding my expertise through a double Master’s in Telecommunications Engineering and Machine Learning. My academic and practical experiences have given me a strong foundation in programming, data analytics, and automation, skills I've applied across various research and internship roles.

My primary interests lie in AI, machine learning, and emerging technologies like cloud computing, all while drawing on a strong foundation in communications and signal processing. I'm driven by the potential these technologies hold to transform industries, making systems smarter, more efficient, and scalable. With a commitment to continuous learning, I’m ready to make an impact in the fast-evolving world of technology and contribute to solutions that harness the power of innovation.
